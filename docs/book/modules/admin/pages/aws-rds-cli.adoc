= Attaching to an AWS RDS instance

Sometimes it may be helpful to have direct access to the database. I case of AWS RDS, this can be a bit more difficult,
as the database is not directly accessible, for good reasons.

However, as the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster has access to the database, it is possible to run a container/pod with
the `psql` command line to on the cluster to access it.

You can run the following command to create a `psql` pod:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create -f examples/psql-pod.yaml
----

This requires the file `psql-pod.yaml` with the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
include::{examplesdir}/psql-pod.yaml[]
----

The secret `postgresql-credentials` is created by the Terraform script.

Afterward, you can attach to the pod by running:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl attach -ti psql
----

Once you are finished, delete the pod using:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete pod psql
----
